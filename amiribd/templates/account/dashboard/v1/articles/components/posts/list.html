                While we strive to support freelancers in their work, there are specific standards and guidelines we uphold to ensure that all content meets the expectations of our clients and platform. Unfortunately, some articles may be rejected if they fall short in certain areas.

                <p><b>High Competition on Topics</b></p>
                With popular or trending topics, multiple freelancers often submit similar articles. This overlap can lead to excess inventory, meaning not all submissions are needed. In such cases, only the highest-quality articles are selected to reduce redundancy.
                
                <p><b>Word Count Requirements</b></p>
                We typically require articles to meet a minimum word count of 800 words. Content that falls short may lack the depth or detail our clients expect. Articles under this threshold are less likely to engage readers fully and may not satisfy SEO guidelines, making them unsuitable for acceptance.
                
                <p><b> Grammar and Proofreading Standards</b></p>
                Articles with grammar issues, spelling mistakes, or lack of thorough proofreading may not present a polished, professional image. This includes poor sentence structure, awkward phrasing, or general readability issues, all of which can detract from the article’s value and credibility.
                
                <p><b>Content Structure and Formatting</b></p>
                Articles should be logically organized with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Poorly structured or haphazard formatting—such as missing headers, inconsistent font usage, or unorganized sections—can diminish reader engagement and make articles challenging to read. Additionally, if content doesn’t adhere to platform guidelines on layout and readability, it may be flagged as inappropriate for publication.
                
                <p><b>Plagiarism and Lack of Originality</b></p>
                We hold strict policies against plagiarism, meaning content copied directly from other sources without significant modification, attribution, or unique perspective may be rejected. If an article appears identical to existing content without added insights, analysis, or improvement, it won’t be accepted. Freelancers are encouraged to use their own words and to provide original insights or perspectives on a topic.
                
                <p><b>Quality of Information and Context</b></p>
                Freelancers should strive to present accurate, relevant, and unbiased information. Content that is outdated, speculative, or overly opinionated can mislead readers, damage credibility, and reflect poorly on our platform. Articles containing fake news, unrealistic claims, hate speech, vulgar language, or any form of targeted negative tone towards individuals or groups are automatically rejected to maintain quality and uphold ethical standards.
                
                <p><b>Timeliness and Relevance of Information</b></p>
                Articles must offer useful, relevant advice or insights that align with current trends or user needs. Content that is obsolete or no longer applicable to today’s standards (e.g., outdated technology advice or expired information) may not be beneficial to readers and could result in rejection.
