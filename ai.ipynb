To everyone's amazement, she began to climb the invisible steps that led to the sky.\\n\\nUp and up she went, until she reached the **Great Sky River**. There, she met creatures of legend and lore, and together, they danced on the clouds, raced comets, and sang songs that echoed through the cosmos.\\n\\nAs dawn approached, Hena knew it was time to return. She descended back to the savannah, her heart full of joy and stories to tell. From that day on, Hena was no longer just a young hyena; she was Hena the Brave, the one who danced with the stars.\\n\\nAnd so, every night, as the little ones of the savannah drifted to sleep, they would dream of Hena's adventures, knowing that bravery and kindness could take them to the stars and beyond.\\n\\nGoodnight, little one. May your dreams be as boundless as Hena's, and may you always reach for the stars. ðŸŒŸ\\n\\nThe end.\\n\""
